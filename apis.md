description: Discogs, short for discographies, is a website and crowdsourced database
  of information about audio recordings, including commercial releases, promotional
  releases, and bootleg or off-label releases. The Discogs servers, currently hosted
  under the domain name discogs.com, are owned by Zink Media, Inc., and are located
  in Portland, Oregon, US. While the site lists releases in all genres and on all
  formats, it is especially known as the largest online database of electronic music
  releases, and of releases on vinyl media. Discogs currently contains over 6 million
  releases, by 3.9 million artists, across over 743,000 labels, contributed from nearly
  238,000 contributor user accounts &ndash; with these figures constantly growing
  as users continually add previously unlisted releases to the site over time
